## What Iâ€™ve Learned and Want to Share

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹  

This repository is a collection of things Iâ€™ve learned from coding. As I explore different programming languages, tools, and techniques, I want to document my journey and share it with others who might find it helpful.  

### Topics Covered  
- Basics of programming (starting with C)  
- Debugging tips and tricks  
- How to use Git and GitHub  
- Problem-solving techniques  
- Linux commands and scripting  
- Open-source contributions  

I believe that learning is a continuous process, and by sharing knowledge, we all grow together. If you're on a similar path, feel free to check out my notes and contribute your own insights!  

Happy coding! ðŸš€
